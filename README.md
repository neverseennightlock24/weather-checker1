# weather-checker1
Checks the weather of any city in the world.

Uses an open-source API key from OpenWeatherMap.org to determine real-time weather-tracking data for this program.

.gitignore has been used to hide the .env file in which the API key is contained; users of this program need not worry about the actual code itself as the program can still access it.
